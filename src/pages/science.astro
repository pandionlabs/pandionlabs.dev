      The amount of data required to do science is only increasing together with the open science and focus on
      reproducibility. Processing this data requires custom softwares. However, to be a good scientist you need to be
      highly specialized in your field. Usually, this means that you cannot also be a professional software engineer and
      this negatively impacts the research.
    </p><p>
      Drawing from our research and coding backgrounds, we provide research software engineering to transform your
      scientific code. We improve the reliability, speed, quality, and reproducibility of your code, helping to bridge
      the gap between your scientific research and the latest innovations in software engineering.
    </p>
    <p>There are concrete ways that we can bring your research to the next levels:</p>

    <h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">Our Toolkit</h2>
    <p>Those are the techniques we use to bring better software to your research:</p>
